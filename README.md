# Flood-it Game
My python implementation of the flood it game.

## Dependencies
Just need matplotlib

## Rules
![](../demo.gif)
The goal is to flood the entire board with one color the faster you can.
You spawn at the top left corner pixel of the board and control a "pivot" composed of all the pixel of the same color. Each turn you'll be ask to change the color of your pivot to capture all the neighbours of this color. That way, you grow your pivot until you have flooded the entire board.

## How does it work ?
Just enter ```python flood.py``` and follow the steps.
